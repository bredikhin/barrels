## Installation

`$ npm i --save-dev barrels`

## Usage

Drop your fixtures in `test/fixtures` as JSON files named after your models.

Once your [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org/) server is started:

    var Barrels = require('barrels');
    var barrels = new Barrels();
    var fixtures = barrels.data;
    barrels.populate(function(err) {
      ...
    });

Pass to the constructor the path to the folder containing your fixtures
(defaults to `./test/fixtures`).

`Populate`'ing the test database involves three steps:

* Removing any existing data from the collection corresponding to the fixture
* Loading the fixture data into the test database
* Automatically applying associations (can be disabled by passing `false` as
  the last parameter to `populate`)

`Populate` also accepts an array of names of collections to populate as
the first (optional) argument, for example:

    barrels.populate(['products'], function(err) {
      // Only products will be populated
      ...
    });

## Automatic association

Use the number of position (starting from one) of an entry in the JSON fixture
as a reference to associate models (see
https://github.com/bredikhin/barrels/blob/master/test/fixtures/products.json
for example). This feature can be disabled by passing `false` as second parameter to `populate`.

## Required associations

If you have any associations described as `required: true`, automatic
association won't work out of the box. In this case you have to load your
fixtures gradually by passing an array of collection names as the first
parameter (available since v1.3.0). This way you can populate your required
associations first, and then take care of all other fixtures.

Let's say, for example, you are implementing a `Passport.js`-based
authentication, and every `Passport` has `User` as a required association. You'd
write something like this:

```javascript
barrels.populate(['user'], function(err) {
  if (err)
    return done(err); // Higher level callback

  // Users will already be populated here, so the required association should work
  barrels.populate(['passport'], function(err) {
    if (err)
      return done(err); // Higher level callback

      // Do your thing...
      done();
    }, false);
  });
```
